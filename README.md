# H-Hello?
I'm going to publish solutions for problem I resolved in the context of practicing or competitive programming.

P.S. Don't expect some profound solutions for contest problems because I'm not experienced in such things and do this to improve personal programming skills.

## Competitions
1. Yandex.Algorithm 2018 (gonna publish later)
2. [VKCup 2018](https://github.com/xtenzQ/CppPracticing/tree/master/Competitive/VKCup2018)
